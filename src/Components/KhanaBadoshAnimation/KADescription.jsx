            Khanabadosh is a brand rooted in movement, culture, and creative rebellion. To bring that spirit alive, I created a glitch-style logo animation that reflects the raw, edgy energy of the brand. The fast flickers, distortion, and digital noise mimic how Khanabadosh breaks from the normâ€”boldly and unapologetically.

          This animation serves as a promotional identity piece, ideal for intros, reels, and branded content.
