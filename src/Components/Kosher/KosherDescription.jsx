            KosherWave is a U.S.-based brand that offers halal-certified, plant-based haircare tools specially designed for individuals with textured, dry, 
            or coarse hair. Their mission is to provide ethical, cruelty-free grooming tools that respect both natural hair and Islamic values.
          </p>

          <p className="description-paragraph">
            As the designer, my goal was to craft a clean, bold, and empowering social media campaign that highlighted the brand's unique identity while 
            remaining culturally respectful and visually engaging.
          </p>

          <p className="description-paragraph">
            The final deliverables included Instagram post templates, story slides, product highlight reels, and campaign visuals that speak directly to Kos. 
            The design language is minimal yet confident â€” bold typography, soft neutral tones, and natural textures that reflect the plant-based ethics 
            of the brand.
