            This project was a freelance commission for Jojo Gymkhana, a local boxing club based in Sargodha. The goal was to create a short, high-energy promotional animation capturing the grit and spirit of the club. I kept the style minimal, focusing on bold motion and strong silhouettes to bring the boxing scene to life.
           </p>
          <p className="description-paragraph">
            The animation works as a quick brand punch â€” something that reflects both the attitude and passion behind the club while staying visually clean and impactful.
