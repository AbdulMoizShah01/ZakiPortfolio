            "Sabar" — the Urdu word for patience — isn't just about waiting. It's about enduring. It's about fighting the storm within.
             This black-and-white anime-style short visualizes the emotional struggle of facing one’s alter ego. Through symbolic combat and raw visual storytelling, it explores how real patience is forged not in silence—but in internal chaos.
